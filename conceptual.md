How is the logged in user being kept track of?
The persistent memory for the logged-in user is in the session (browser session, using the underlying technology of cookies)

What is Flaskâ€™s g object?
It is a global object (can be used like a container, setting its properties to relevant data, like the user class instance), available everywhere throughout the Flask app on a per-request basis.

What is the purpose of add_user_to_g?
That is why before every request, we write @app.before_request functions that access the session and get the user instance, and put it in the g object for every single request. We can then very conveniently access user properties inside Jinja without having to explicitly passing it in with every render_template call (especially for putting csrf tokens into every logout form button!)

What does @app.before_request mean?
It runs every time, before any route (not unlike setUp in unittest)
